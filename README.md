This simple ecommerce website was created from the ground up using various languages including:
PHP, JavaScript, Jquery, MySql, Bootstrap, HandlebarJS, AngularJS, HTML 5, and CSS.

The goal for this project was to completely create a working and functional site for online shopping.

Requirements for this project include using MySQL to store user information as well as product information. Along side that,
a broad range of languages were to be covered so various parts of the site were recreated or updated to use different 
programming languages to solve the same issues. An example of this includes the nav bar where the link to a page would be highlighted if it was the current page. At first this was handled in PHP but, we updated it so that it was done in JavaScript.
